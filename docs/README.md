# Muxy Documentation

> **Reading this as an LLM?** Start from <https://muxy.app/llms.txt> — an index of every page that links to its raw Markdown source. Append `/plain` to any docs URL (e.g. <https://muxy.app/docs/extensions/manifest/plain>) for that page's raw Markdown.

Muxy is a native macOS terminal multiplexer organized around projects, worktrees, tabs, and split panes. It also ships a source-control UI and a WebSocket API for companion apps.
