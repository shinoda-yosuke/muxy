# Topbar Items

A topbar item is an icon Muxy adds to the right-hand cluster of the tab strip — the same row that holds the VCS, file-diff, and file-tree buttons. Clicking it runs one of the extension's declared [commands](palette-commands.md).

```json
{
  "commands": [
    { "id": "open-pr", "title": "Open PR…", "action": { "kind": "openTab", "tabType": "pr-viewer" } }
  ],
  "topbarItems": [
    {
      "id": "pr",
      "icon": { "symbol": "arrow.triangle.pull" },
      "tooltip": "Open Pull Request",
      "command": "open-pr"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | yes | Unique within the extension. |
| `icon` | object | yes | `{ "symbol": "<sf-symbol>" }` or `{ "svg": "<path>" }`. A bare string is treated as a symbol. See [Icons](manifest.md#icons). |
| `tooltip` | string | no | Hover tooltip and accessibility label. Defaults to the `id`. |
| `command` | string | yes | Must reference a declared `commands[].id`. |

## Behavior

A click dispatches the referenced command through the same path as the command palette, running its `action` (`event`, `openTab`, or `runScript`). The action's permissions still apply — e.g. a `runScript` action needs `commands:run-script`. See [Permissions](permissions.md).

Disabled extensions contribute no topbar items.

## Updating the icon at runtime

The icon can be swapped while the extension runs — from `background.js` or any tab/panel/popover page — with `muxy.topbar.set`:

```js
muxy.topbar.set({ id: "pr", icon: { symbol: "checkmark.circle.fill" } });
muxy.topbar.set({ id: "pr", icon: "arrow.triangle.pull" }); // bare string == symbol
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Must reference a declared `topbarItems[].id`. |
| `icon` | string \| object | New icon: `"<sf-symbol>"`, `{ symbol }`, or `{ svg }` (the SVG must be a file bundled with the extension). Omit to leave the icon unchanged. |

Needs `panels:write`. The override is in-memory for the session; disabling or reloading the extension restores the manifest icon. Throws on an unknown `id`.

## Placement and order

Items sit in the right-hand cluster, just before the built-in **Split / New Tab** group. Among themselves they are ordered by extension directory name, then by their order in the `topbarItems` array.

## Limits

- A `command` that references an unknown id fails the manifest load.
- SVG icons must live inside the extension directory, end in `.svg`, and be at most 256 KiB.
